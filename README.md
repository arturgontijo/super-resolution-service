This service uses convolutional neural networks to increase the resolution of an image by reconstructing rather than simply resizing it. It can upscale images by a factor of 2, 4 or 8.

This repository was forked from [fperazzi/proSR](https://github.com/fperazzi/proSR). The original code is written in Python 3 (using Pytorch) and has been integrated into the SingularityNET using Python 3.6.
